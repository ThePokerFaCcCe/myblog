sandbox created ids doesn't start from 0
sandbox for instances like Post.likes.**class**.filter(...)
sandbox for serializers and their primarykeyfield

NOTE:
*I don't exactly know why I wanted to build this!
*I can just start server with another config in subdomain\
*and use that for testing...
*But I will save this feature in another branch for later if needed.
